- Minor bug fixes and optimizations.

06.06.2022 - nAc v0.4.20-RC03

- Fixed an issue on Mac that sometimes caused the application under the mouse cursor to falsely believe that certain modifier keys were being pressed after a Quick Assignment was activated.
- If a MIDI device used in an assignment is unavailable when nAC starts up, nAc will attempt to replace it with another one that has the same name.

04.11.2021 - nAc v0.4.12
- Minor cursor controller optimizations.

03.08.2021 - nAc v0.4.11
- Fixed a minor bug on Mac, which could cause the key presses generated by nAc (via the key press controller) to accidentally trigger other assignments.

30.07.2021 - nAc v0.4.1
- Fixed an issue that sometimes caused nAc to stop responding to keyboard hotkeys on Mac.
- Minor bug fixes.

18.07.2021 - nAc v0.4.1-RC01
- Fixed an issue that sometimes blocked the keyboard input on Mac, when nAc was dragging something on the screen.
- Hotkeys generated by Elgato’s Stream Deck and other third-party software/hardware systems are now properly being detected by nAc.
- nAc can now detect whether a window belongs to a Logic Pro plugin instance, and replaces internally the default window title (which is basically the track name) with a unique identification number that corresponds to the specific plugin. This way, Quick Assignments can now be used with Logic plugins, as each instance of a plugin is properly detected, no matter the name of the track it’s being used on.
- If nAc detects a window with no title (like for example the floating fader window in Pro Tools), nAc assigns internally a placeholder name to the window, so that it can be detected and managed properly.
- Profiles can now be duplicated by holding Alt and dragging to another slot in the profile list. Holding Alt and clicking on the ‘plus’ icon down in the profile list will also duplicate the currently active profile.
- Minor optimizations and stability improvements.

07.01.2021 - nAc v0.4.0-RC02
- Minor stability improvements

23.12.2020 - nAc v0.4.0-RC01
- In cursor controller mode, the primary mouse button can be now set to “no click”. Turning the knob will just move the mouse cursor and no mouse clicks will be performed.
- In cursor controller mode, there is now the possibility to set the direction to “force diagonal”, which might be seen as a “universal” direction, as this direction works pretty well with most vertical and horizontal UI elements.
- The tray/menu bar icon turns green when an assignment is active.
- New section for setting up MIDI and OSC assignments
- Support for 7-bit and 14-bit MIDI and 32-bit floating point OSC control signals.
- Support for relative and absolute control.
- Support for creating custom curves for mapping knob’s rotation to output control signals.
- Individual sensitivity settings for each configuration.
- Support for controlling multiple parameters at once.

13.03.2020 - nAc v0.3.0-RC1
- Added a new control mode called “Key press controller”. With this mode, nAc will repeatedly press specific key combinations, while the knob is being turned. The faster the knob is being turned, the more often these simulated key combinations will be pressed. 
- The middle mouse button can now be set as the primary mouse button in cursor controller mode.
- In cursor and scroll wheel controller modes, there is now the option to set modifier keys that will be automatically pressed as soon as the user starts turning the knob.
- Simply touching the knob can be set as an activation hotkey for Quick Assignments.
- The direction (vertical or horizontal) and the cursor behaviour (drag or stationary) can optionally be set in the profile, which will result in nAc ignoring the toggle switches on the nOb controller.
- Only the options related to the current control mode are visible in the UI.
- Several minor improvements have been implemented related to the activation of Quick Assignments and the on-the-fly switching between profiles.
- Bug fixes related to hotkeys on non-US keyboard layouts.

- If the mouse cursor accidentally ends outside the bounds of an assignment's window,  it gets snapped back into the window at the last known usable position.
- Fixed issue related to super quick assignments that caused a random crash on Mac.
- Added MacOS 10.15 Catalina support. Known issue: Some users might experience problems with updating nOb’s firmware. Please contact info@nobcontrol.com for more.
- Updated nOb firmware (for sending HW diagnostic data to nAc).
- Added secret menu for diagnosing HW problems and saving data for analysis.

09.07.2019 - nAc v0.2.0-RC3
- Fixed issue with non-working hotkeys containing the Alt-Gr key on Windows. nAc now treats this key as a combination of Ctrl+Alt, in order to ensure maximum compatibility.
- Fixed a bug on Windows, which was responsible for the occasional blocking of any keyboard/mouse input when switching between profiles with different control modes, if nAc was running with administrator privileges.
- Fixed an occasional crash on Mac related to improper handling of a window reference  inside a quick assignment. 
- Fixed an issue that prevented properly switching between two super quick assignments when double-tapping on the left toggle switch.
